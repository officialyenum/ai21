### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

#### How to import

1. ES Modules
   ```javascript
    // Javascript Sample
    import { AI21 } from "@officialyenum/ai21";
   ```
   ```typescript
    // Typescript Sample
    import { AI21 } from "@officialyenum/ai21";
   ```
2. Common JS

   ```

#### How to construct

  - Ways to construct

1. Initialize
   ```javascript
   // Javascript Sample
   const token = "pDsubXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXYSg8y"; // pass your AI21 Labs AI Token Here
   const ai = new AI21(token);
   ```
   ```typescript
   // Typescript Sample
   const token = process.env.AI21_TOKEN  as string; // pass your AI21 Labs AI Token Here
   const ai = new AI21(token);
   ```

2. Summarize
   ```javascript
   // Javascript Sample
    const data = {
        text: "Olives, wheat and grapes have been the staple foods of the Mediterranean world, with seafood, above meat, as the preferred protein source. Fish and shellfish were used often since ancient times by wealthy classes as a kind of social marker, not only as a gastronomic delight, but also as a way to stay healthier. This paper reviews thoroughly how seafood has been present in the dietary practices of the Mediterranean people since ancient Egyptians up to the gastronomic discourse of some celebrated contemporary chefs. Preferences for particular tastes and flavors, local traditions, myths and religious rites (such Lent, Shabbat and Ramadan that prohibited eating some foods and allowed others) as well as cultural exchanges between countries and civilizations (with the incorporation of new ingredients and culinary techniques), have shaped the Mediterranean culinary customs along the history. Such traditions are reflected in many ancient writings, culinary literature and cookbooks. We will analyze some of these sources with special attention to those excerpts, anecdotes, cookbooks, recipes, cooks and even characters related to seafood. Knowledge and learning from our rich Mediterranean culinary heritage are important aspects to bear in mind. Whereas some contemporary celebrity chefs (and probably many diners) are not fully aware of such culinary legacy, others like Ferran Adri`a have recently recognized the importance of studying the past as a driver for creation and gastronomic innovation.",

3. Summarize Restaurant Review
   ```javascript
   // Javascript Sample
   const data = {
    restaurant: "La Taqueria",
    review: "La Taqueria is a tiny place with 3 long tables inside and 2 small tables outside. The inside is cramped, but the outside is pleasant. Unfortunately, we had to sit inside as all the outside tables were taken. The tacos are delicious and reasonably priced and the salsa is spicy and flavorful. Service was friendly. Aside from the seating, the only thing I didn't like was the lack of parking - we had to walk six blocks to find a spot"
    type: "reviews",
   }
   const resp = await ai.summarize(data);
   console.log(resp);
    // status : success | failed

    //}
    console.log(resp.data["completions"][0]["data"]["text"].trim());
    // The data you need in all of this is data["completions"][0]["data"]["text"]
    //  ==> "Excellent tacos. Very spicy salsa. Cramped inside."
   ```

4. Rewrite

   ```

#### Properties

1. `shows your token`
   ```javascript
   console.log(ai.token); // pDsubXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXYSg8y
   ```

### Testing

- In this test, I use sinon to create a stub for the axios.post method so that I can control its behavior in the tests. 
- I also use chai to make assertions about the expected behavior of the AI21 class.

- The beforeEach and afterEach hooks are used to create a new instance of the AI21 class and stub the axios.post method for each test, respectively.

- We have Twelve test cases:
  - AI21
    - Summarize
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if token is not initialized
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if data is not specified
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if type is not specified in the data
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if type is review and restaurant and review is not specified in the data
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if text is more than 10000 characters
      - ‚úî should return a successful response if the request is successful
      - ‚úî should return a failed response if the request fails

  19 passing (69ms)

- In each test, I use chai assertions to check that the method behaves as expected, based on the inputs and the stubbed behavior of axios.post.
